# **Python Crash Course NITK**

Welcome to the **Python Crash Course repository**, a comprehensive collection of notes, assignments, and code files from the Python Crash Course conducted at **National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK)**.  

This repository serves as a complete guide for learning Python from the ground up, structured day-by-day with organized folders for each session.  

---

## **Repository Structure**  
- Each day is organized into folders  
- Inside each folder:
  - **`codes.ipynb`**: Contains classroom coding examples and implementations.  
  - **`notes.md`**: Contains in-depth explanations and notes for the day's concepts.  
  - Supporting files and outputs are stored in subfolders as required.
